 * help center. Page text is kept out of the browsers that report no private window
 * (`PRIVATE_WINDOW_UNDETECTABLE_BROWSER_BUNDLE_IDS` in the recorder, which
 * `zaneiConfig` leaves at its default), while every browser is still recorded like an
 * ordinary app, titles included — so the browser line never claims that a browser is

 * Until they are granted the app can read nothing, so no conversation window opens
 * at all: this screen is what a request that was stopped by that gate turns into.
 * It also opens on its own while the permissions are missing, because turning
 * recording on is what asks macOS for them — this is that toggle, with the words
 * that explain it. "Later" is answered in main and holds for the rest of the app
 * run, so reopening this window does not ask again; the gate itself is the live
 * OS permission, and nothing about either is stored.
