```

## Zanei

Activity recording is performed by the Zanei recorder, a separate binary that Pantaray starts
and reads. The release tarball is fetched at build time and pinned by SHA-256, and the recorder
is installed at `Pantaray.app/Contents/Resources/zanei/bin/zanei`. Zanei is dual-licensed under
MIT or Apache-2.0, at your option.

Zanei's own third-party notices ship next to the binary, at
`Pantaray.app/Contents/Resources/zanei/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

`frontend/tests/fixtures/zanei_privacy_parity_cases.json` is a verbatim copy of Zanei's
`crates/zanei-core/tests/privacy_parity_cases.json` at the pinned release, under the same license.
It is test data and does not ship in the app.

## sqlite-vec

Vector search over the local SQLite store uses the sqlite-vec extension, which is distributed
under the MIT license:

## PDFium

Drawing a PDF page as an image uses PDFium, the PDF engine from Chrome, reached through the
`pypdfium2` package. The package carries a prebuilt `libpdfium.dylib` produced by
[pdfium-binaries](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries), installed at
`Pantaray.app/Contents/Resources/local_backend_helper/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pypdfium2_raw/`.

PDFium is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license:

The `pypdfium2` bindings are offered under `Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause`, and are taken here
under the 3-clause BSD license reproduced above, with the copyright held by geisserml
(`SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 geisserml <geisserml@gmail.com>`). The `pdfium-binaries` build
scripts are MIT, Copyright 2014-2025 Benoit Blanchon.

PDFium links further libraries into that binary — among them FreeType, libjpeg-turbo, libpng,
zlib, ICU, Little CMS, OpenJPEG, libtiff, Abseil, AGG and simdutf. Their notices are not
reproduced here: the package ships them next to the code that carries them, and they are
installed with it at
`Pantaray.app/Contents/Resources/local_backend_helper/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pypdfium2-5.13.0.dist-info/licenses/`,
where `LICENSES/` holds the bindings' own license texts and
`data/darwin_arm64/BUILD_LICENSES/` holds one file per library compiled into `libpdfium.dylib`.

## bekko-embedding-v1-a25m

Semantic memory search embeds text on the machine, with the
`hotchpotch/bekko-embedding-v1-a25m` model published on Hugging Face. The build fetches the
model's own arm64 int8 ONNX graph and its tokenizer at the revision pinned in
`frontend/electron/embedding_model_release.json`, verifies both against the SHA-256 digests
pinned there, and installs them at `Pantaray.app/Contents/Resources/local_embedding_model/`.
The files are the published ones unchanged, and nothing is fetched at run time.

At that revision the model repository carries no `LICENSE` file and no copyright notice of its
own; its model card declares `license: mit` and names Yuichi Tateno (@hotchpotch) as the author:
<https://huggingface.co/hotchpotch/bekko-embedding-v1-a25m/blob/44f0b8af0f487acd0ccf1a7cb7ae7a29a6dfc09c/README.md>

Its backbone is [mmBERT-L13H384-pruned](https://huggingface.co/hotchpotch/mmBERT-L13H384-pruned)
(MIT), pruned from [mmBERT-small](https://huggingface.co/jhu-clsp/mmBERT-small) (MIT), which is
described in "mmBERT: A Modern Multilingual Encoder with Annealed Language Learning"
(arXiv:2509.06888). The mmBERT model card states that its tokenizer is the Gemma 2 tokenizer.

## Sora

The Pantaray wordmark is set in a subset of the Sora typeface, which is distributed under the
SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1:

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font

## CPython and the Python dependency tree

The local runtime runs on a relocatable CPython 3.12.13 build taken from release `20260325` of
[astral-sh/python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone). The
archive is pinned by SHA-256 at build time and installed, together with the Python packages in
`agents/uv.lock`, at `Pantaray.app/Contents/Resources/local_backend_helper`.

That interpreter build, the libraries compiled into it, and the bundled Python packages are each
distributed under their own licenses, which are not reproduced in this file.
