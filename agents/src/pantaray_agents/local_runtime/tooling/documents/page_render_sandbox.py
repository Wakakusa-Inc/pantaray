The renderer runs PDFium over a file the user did not write, so on macOS -- the
platform Pantaray ships on -- it runs under a seatbelt profile that denies the
network, denies every write, and allows reading only what the interpreter needs
to start and the single PDF that was asked for. The profile is written here
rather than reusing the one behind the bash and run_python tools: that one is
built around an approved command, its workspace and its audit trail, none of
which a page render has. What is shared is the list of system roots any process
on this machine reads to run at all.
