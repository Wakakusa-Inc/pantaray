    """The subset of ``specs`` the runtime may claim right now.

    Nothing at all is claimed while the admission gate is closed, not even the
    Action the user just submitted: an identity change is in flight, and a job
    claimed now would start against an identity that is about to be replaced.
    The gate reopens at the end of the barrier and the job is claimed on the next
    poll (design 6.2).

    Nothing is claimed before Electron main applies ``configure``: the runtime
    has not been told the connection yet, and the wait is over in milliseconds
    (design 6.2).

    After that the two kinds part ways. A job the user started is always
    claimed, even with no route and even while the cloud session is expired, so
    that it fails where the GUI shows it rather than sitting queued in silence
    (design 6.4 step 3 and 7.1 step 5). Background jobs have nobody waiting, and
    failing one is final: the activity summary cursor has already advanced and
    the memory triggers are already dispatched, so that period's summary,
    Insight and memory never come back, not even once the user connects. They
    are claimed only when the request could really be sent.

    That means a live cloud session, or a stored connection that can send right
    now. The two states that come back on their own -- an expired cloud session
    and a lapsed ChatGPT token -- are neither, so their background jobs wait
    rather than spend their one attempt (design 6.4 step 3, 6.6).
