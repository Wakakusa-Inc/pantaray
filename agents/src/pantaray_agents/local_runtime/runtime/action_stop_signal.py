"""Durable read of "this Action run has been told to stop".

``ActionCancellationService`` owns the run's cancellation *decision* at node
boundaries, including what to do when the read itself keeps failing. This module
reads the same durable facts for a different consumer: an in-flight tool call
polls it so it can be cancelled now instead of at the next node boundary. A
failed poll must never terminalize a run, so this reader has no failure policy of
its own - it answers the question or raises, and the caller keeps polling.

Two write-once rows carry the fact, and either one is enough:

- ``jobs.cancel_requested_at`` - the Stop fence recorded on the run's own job.
  A Stop always fences the parent job (``action_cancel_repository.py``), and a
  Stop that still owns a running subagent fences the child job the same way
  (``action_subagent_cancel.py``), so this covers both a parent run and a
  subagent run without knowing which one is asking.
- ``agent_actions.status = 'canceled'`` - the Action terminal an earlier Stop
  already committed.

Neither value is ever cleared, so an observation here can be acted on without
re-reading: the run is stopping.
