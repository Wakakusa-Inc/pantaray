"""Stop a running Action immediately instead of at the next node boundary.

A Stop is a durable row, not a signal the running graph can receive: the node
boundaries read it through ``ActionCancellationService`` and converge there. That
makes the user wait for whatever is in flight - a ``bash`` build, a 60s web
fetch, a stalled THINK - before the run reacts.

This module closes that gap without moving the cancellation decision. While a
call is in flight, the watch polls the same durable fact
(``action_stop_signal.action_stop_requested``) and, the moment it is recorded,
cancels the awaited task. The call's own boundary then finalizes what it started
- audit row, tool result, step row - and the node converges the run to
``canceled``. Nothing here decides *whether* a run stops; it decides *when* the
in-flight work learns about it.

What cancellation means per call is owned by the call, not by this module:
``bash``/``run_python`` kill the sandbox process group
(``command_sandbox_client.py``), HTTP-backed tools abort the request, and
``apply_patch`` is run uncancellable by its caller so a half-written file is
never possible.

A poll that fails is logged and retried: this watch only ever *starts* a
cancellation that the node boundary would have reached anyway, so it must not
terminalize a run of its own accord. The boundary check keeps its fail-closed
policy for repeated read failures.
